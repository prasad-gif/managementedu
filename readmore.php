<h4>ARE YOU TOO OLD TO BE AN SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR?</h4>
  <P>Entrepreneur is a word which can be referred to anyone irrespective of their ages. Entrepreneur is nothing but a pure passion. Some people succeed at their early age and some take time. But this does not mean the later are not smart, it’s just a matter of correct time. Entrepreneurship deals with experience which old people may always have. There are many successful entrepreneurs who succeeded late in their life but now are far ahead than the people who had succeeded at an early stage of their life. Entrepreneurs like Warren Buffett, Ray Kroc also started late in their life yet succeeded. They had also set an example for many other people. Some start their business after getting retired and some start their business by dropping out of college. In today’s 21st century we see students doing startups, running successful YouTube channel, working and developing their own brand. These are all good signs where students will learn from their failures and develop themselves and also be an inspiration for the youths. Age is never an issue for running successful business.  It’s just a change of mindset as you grow older and are ready to take the risks. Entrepreneurs with big dreams have to face tough times because of course nothing comes easier as a cookie. Those who understand this start to strive to be a successful person.
